# EEG-Preprocessing


I first assigned labels to the csv file based on the .txt you sent me, used some numpy filters to apply a band pass, used a standard scaler to diminish spikes in the signal, then I flattened the 2d array and labeled it 1 or 0 based on whether it was focused or unfocused. Then, I just plotted individual channels on matlab.
